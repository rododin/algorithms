algorithms

The project introduces all basic algorithm and data structure implementations in Java and can be used learning.

It has been started in 2014 in context of my academy work on the role of assistant professor at 
Donetsk National Technical University, Ukraine. 
Then it was frozen for a long period of time once I was too busy with my full time job/projects.
Now (January 2020), despite I'm still busy with many things, I'd like to continue here in order of recovering and 
improving my own algorithm/data structure backgorund...

There was (and still is) a plan to add here all basic algorithm and data structure implementations covered in well known 
books of the subject + probably something more. 
For now I plan to use the following books in my work over the project:

1. ISBN 0-201-36120-5. Robert Sedgewick. Algorithms in Java. Parts 1-4. 3rd Edition. Addison-Wesley, 2002.
2. ISBN 0-201-36121-3. Robert Sedgewick. Algorithms in Java. Part 5: Graph Algorithms. Addison-Wesley, 2003.
3. ISBN 978-0-321-57351-3. Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne. Algorithms. 4th Edition. Addison-Wesley, 2011.
4. ISBN 978-1-84800-069-8. Steven S. Skiena. The Algorithm Design Manual. Second Edition. Springer, 2008.
5. ISBN 0-201-89683-4. Knuth, D. E. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms. 3rd ed. Addison-Wesley, 1997.
6. ISBN 0-201-89684-2. Knuth, D. E. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms. 3rd ed. Addison-Wesley, 1998.
7. ISBN 0-201-89685-0. Knuth, D. E. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 3: Sorting and Searching. 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley, 1998.
8. ISBN 9781617292231. Aditya Y. Bhargava. Grokking algorithms. Manning Publications Co, 2016.

If more sources will be used, appropriate references will be added.
