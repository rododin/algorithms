# Algorithms

The project had been created in 2014 to practice with miscellaneous algorithm, data structure and problem solving implementations in Java.
Then it was frozen for a long period of time because I was too busy with my full time job/projects.
Now (in 2020), despite I'm still busy with many things, I'd like to continue here, again, first of all, to practice 
and improve my background in the area of fundamental programming.

There was (and still is) a plan to add here all well-known algorithm and data structure implementations,
as well as many well-known problem solutions.

Many problems are coming from [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com).
