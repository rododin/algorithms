algorithms
==========

The project introduces all basic algorithm and data structure implementations in Java and can be used for algorithm and data structure studying.
I am starting it as a part of my academy work at the role of assistant professor at Donetsk National Technical University, Ukraine.
With time I plan to add here all basic algorithm implementations covered in the books of Robert Sedgewick, Steven Skiena and Donald Knuth.

For now I plan to use the following books in my work over the project:

1. ISBN 0-201-36120-5. Robert Sedgewick. Algorithms in Java. Parts 1-4. 3rd Edition. Addison-Wesley, 2002.
2. ISBN 0-201-36121-3. Robert Sedgewick. Algorithms in Java. Part 5: Graph Algorithms. Addison-Wesley, 2003.
3. ISBN 978-0-321-57351-3. Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne. Algorithms. 4th Edition. Addison-Wesley, 2011.
4. 978-1-84800-069-8. Steven S. Skiena. The Algorithm Design Manual. Second Edition. Springer, 2008.
5. ISBN 0-201-89683-4. Knuth, D. E. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms. 3rd ed. Addison-Wesley, 1997.
6. ISBN 0-201-89684-2. Knuth, D. E. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms. 3rd ed. Addison-Wesley, 1998.
7. ISBN 0-201-89685-0. Knuth, D. E. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 3: Sorting and Searching. 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley, 1998.

Probably other authors and books will be used in the work as well. Appropriate references will be added.

Some good implementations will be probably added by my students.
